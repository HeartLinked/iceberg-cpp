# Release

## Overview

    1. Test the revision to be released
    2. Prepare RC and vote (detailed later)
    3. Publish (detailed later)

### Prepare RC and vote

Run `dev/release/release_rc.sh` on a working copy of
`git@github.com:apache/iceberg-cpp` not from your fork:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:apache/iceberg-cpp.git
$ dev/release/release_rc.sh ${VERSION} ${RC}
(Send a vote email to dev@iceberg.apache.org.
 You can use a draft shown by release_rc.sh for the email.)
```

Here is an example to release RC0 of version 0.1.0:

```console
$ GH_TOKEN=${YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN} dev/release/release_rc.sh 0.1.0 0
```

The arguments of `release_rc.sh` are the version and the RC number. If RC0 has a problem, we'll increment the RC number such as RC1, RC2 and so on.

Requirements to run `release_rc.sh`:

    * You must be an Apache Iceberg committer or PMC member
    * You must prepare your PGP key for signing

If you don't have a PGP key, https://infra.apache.org/release-signing.html#generate
may be helpful.

Your PGP key must be published in the KEYS file, which is hosted at:

    * https://downloads.apache.org/iceberg/KEYS

See the header comment of them for how to add a PGP key.

If you are a first-time release manager, you need to add your public key to this file. To prevent formatting errors, please use the following commands instead of editing the file manually:

+ Check out the release distribution directory:

```console
$ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/iceberg
$ cd iceberg
```
+ Append your GPG public key to the KEYS file. Replace <YOUR_KEY_ID> with your actual GPG key ID.

```console
$ echo "" >> KEYS   # append a newline
$ gpg --list-sigs <YOUR_KEY_ID> >> KEYS  # append signatures
$ gpg --armor --export <YOUR_KEY_ID> >> KEYS # append public key block
$ svn commit -m "Add GPG key for <YOUR_NAME>"
```

### Publish

We need to publish to apache.org to publish a new release.

Run `dev/release/release.sh` to publish to apache.org:

```console
$ GH_TOKEN=${YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN} dev/release/release.sh ${VERSION} ${RC}
```

Add the release to ASF's report database via [Apache Committee Report Helper](https://reporter.apache.org/addrelease.html?iceberg)

### Verify

We have a script for verifying a RC.

You must install the following to run the script:

    * `curl`
    * `gpg`
    * `shasum` or `sha512sum`
    * `tar`
    * `cmake` (3.25 or higher)
    * C++23 compliant compiler (GCC 13+ or Clang 16+)

To verify a RC, run the following:

```console
$ dev/release/verify_rc.sh ${VERSION} ${RC}
```

If the verification is successful, the message `RC looks good!` is shown.
